## Factory â€” Ride Booking System

### Use Case
A ride booking app needs to create different types of rides (Car, Bike, Auto) based on user selection. Instead of hardcoding `new CarRide()`, `new BikeRide()`, etc., use a factory to handle the creation logic in one place.

### Participants (in this code)
- `Ride` (interface): Common contract for all ride types.
- `CarRide`, `BikeRide`, `AutoRide` (concrete products): Specific ride implementations.
- `RideFactory` (factory): Creates rides based on input type.
- `Main` (client): Uses the factory to get rides and demonstrates booking.
